    <h1>My Journal</h1>
    Dear diary. I never thought my computer could make me feel stupid. 
    Wrong! Granted I have only used a mac for a little over a month...

    I hate github. One day I may love it. But since I pretty much spent the day with 
    the assistants I can only blame git hub.

        <p>I don't believe that cohort 25 are actually humans. I think they are robots 
            created to fool us into believing this is possible</p>

    <h6>July 2nd. I have started with co-hort 27 today at NSS. I had been in co-hort26 and fell behind due to personal issues. The extra month helped a little bit. A got two extra weeks of study in. However on the third week my laptop died and needed to be sent off. I had to go to Knoxville for 4 days twice to help family. And to top the week off I sprained my wrist making typing painfull. Ok I guess moving to 27 was a good plan....</h6>
