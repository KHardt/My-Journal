    <h1>My Journal</h1>
    Dear diary. I never thought my computer could make me feel stupid. 
    Wrong! Granted I have only used a mac for a little over a month...

    I hate github. One day I may love it. But since I pretty much spent the day with 
    the assistants I can only blame git hub.

            created to fool us into believing this is possible</p>
